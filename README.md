# The rainbowR buddy scheme

The rainbowR buddy scheme is designed to connect LGBTQ+ people who code in the R language. We hope it's fun for the folks who take part, and that it helps foster the community. We envisage this buddy scheme as primarily **social**, though you know that anyone who takes part will have a shared interest in R. Any experience level with R is welcome! 

## How it works

- Folks opt-in via this [sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XdTvtKkVF8Ek7MJ5CYbh6PV8oR72zIV9wRUVTHUP5yQ)
- Buddy pairs are randomly assigned
- E-mails are sent to each pair making the introduction.

This is implemented in [R](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/buddies/blob/main/buddies.R).

We'll send the emails on November 30th 2023. We trust that the assigned buddies will want to communicate with each other, and get in touch with each other via email. We anticipate that buddies will arrange a meet-up (most likely online), though there are no firm expectations/requirements to do so. Maybe they'll just meet once. Maybe they'll become friends for life! 

In the form we ask for a little about yourself and things that you'd be interested in talking about or doing together, and give some examples of things you might consider:

- Discuss/get feedback on a project you're working on (either R-related or something completely different)
- Explore a [TidyRainbow](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/tidyrainbow) dataset together
- Work on some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode) puzzles together (either new ones in December or some from previous years)
- Do some [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) together
- Play some online games, e.g. some of those listed [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=j&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbest-free-web-browser-party-games%2F&uct=1694511574&usg=t0zNc9gJyPFNYBSey58bx0wl2w8.&source=editors)
- General chat is fine too!

To help get the conversation started, what you write about yourself and your interests will be included in the emails introducing each buddy pair (though buddies are assigned randomly, not on mutual interests).

## Keeping it safe
We want the scheme to be fun and safe for everyone, so it operates under the rainbowR [code of conduct](https://rainbowr.netlify.app/CoC.html). All the information entered in the sign-up form is confidential. It is seen just by me ([Ella Kaye](https://ellakaye.co.uk), the organiser of rainbowR) and the assigned buddies. There is a GitHub [repo](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/buddies) for the implementation of the scheme, but no personal details will ever be checked in there. If you're interested in taking part but have any questions or concerns, please email [rlgbtq@gmail.com](mailto:rlgbtq@gmail.com) and I will do my best to address them. 

## Get involved
It would be wonderful to get a good number of people involved in the scheme, so please do sign up if you're interested! If you know anyone else who might be interested, please do share this post with them. The deadline for signing up for the first round of the scheme is **November 29th 2023**. We plan to run the scheme every three months (people will need to opt-in each time).
